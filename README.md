# mogusbot
The mogus bot is one my biggest Js projects.
I started actually learning Js basics with the discordjs. I am enjoying it so far.
Yes, i get it the among us is a "dead" meme. but i and many of my friends still enjoy em' so i tought I would theme the bot around it.

Some features: (prefix is .sus)

COMMANDS
chad - generate a random image from the chads folder.
randomsus - generates a random word ending with "us".
sussypic - generates a random picture from the images folder
random - sussypic&randomsus combined

PASSIVE
The bot has a 1 out of 50 chance to reply to a message with a positive or negative quote. You can change them in the "noprefix" folder / reply.ks

I also plan on using database management with all sorts of other features like a working website and musicbot. 
And maybe a connecting it with a TS3 bot so it would tunnel the audio thru the two platforms
